     Daniah Mohammed Zaheda from Hebron, computer systems engineering student at Palestine Polytechnic University. 
    I aspire to be a web developer. I presented the Children of Alhuria program on alhuria Radio.
    and I like to play chess. I don't like competition when I play. I just play for fun.
    I write in Kufic, but my normal handwriting is bad
